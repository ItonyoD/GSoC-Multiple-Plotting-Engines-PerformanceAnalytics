# GSoC-Multiple-Plotting-Engines-PerformanceAnalytics

These are my test solution results for my application to the [Google Summer of code R project, Multiple Plotting Engines for PerformanceAnalytics](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2019/wiki/Multiple-plotting-engines-for-PerformanceAnalytics).


 - [COMPLETE: "basic"](https://github.com/ItonyoD/GSoC-Multiple-Plotting-Engines-PerformanceAnalytics/tree/master/Basic-Test-Results): clone the repository and install the PerformanceAnalytics package and its dependencies locally


- [IN PROGRESS: "intermediate"](): propose a patch via a pull request for any open issue on the PerformanceAnalytics package, or for a new feature you think would be useful to have in PerformanceAnalytics .

- [IN PROGRESS: "expert"](): implement one of the models described in the scope of the GSoC project idea here. Most of these models are expected to take a few hours each to code the function, so a prototype should be achievable.
